## Description

read-tv is a shiny application and associated console interface designed for visualizing changepoints in __irregularly and regularly spaced__ longitudinal data. Technical users can rapidly view data through the R console interface, and non-technical users can use it as a standard web application. Intermediate users, as well as users who want to replicate plots, will benefit from the source code generation associated with any plot.

This application is built on top of a wide array of packages, and especially wraps functionality from the [changepoint](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/changepoint/index.html) package and [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse) set of packages.

Below is a plot of new COVID-19 cases in the United States with detected changepoints.

## Installation
This package is not on CRAN. Please install from GitHub with the [install_github function from the Devtools package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/versions/2.3.2).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install devtools if not yet installed
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JDMusc/READ-TV")
```


## Usage

### Data requirements

A data frame or RDS/CSV file where each row is an observation. If the data does not have columns for Case, Event.Type, or Time, then read-tv will open a pop-up that enables the user to map Case and Event.Type to another column (or mock value), and map Time to a column.

### The main function is **launchReadtv**:

```{r}
# launchReadtv() #uncomment to launch the web application
```

Or it can be launched as 
```{r}
app = readtv::launchReadtv()
#shiny::runApp(app) #uncomment to launch the web application
```

Both files and in-memory objects can be passed to **launchReadtv**
```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(readtv)

app = readtv::japan_eq_3_11 %>% 
  mutate(Time = time, Event.Type = place, Case = 1) %>% #bypass popup
  launchReadtv(plotOpts = tvOpts(y = mag, x = Time, color = place))

#shiny::runApp(app)
```

Executing the above ```shiny::runApp(app)``` code will generate the following plot. The ```plotOpts``` argument and the ```tvOpts``` function tells the plot to load with the specified axes, colors, etc.

If the code is run without the ```mutate``` call, then a pop-up first requests the user to map the ```Case```, ```Time```, and ```Event.Type``` columns.

```{r}
app = readtv::japan_eq_3_11 %>% 
  launchReadtv(plotOpts = tvOpts(y = mag, x = Time, color = place))

#shiny::runApp(app)
```

<img src="tools/readme/japan_eq_popup.png">

The ```Filter & Facet``` tab will show the same plot after the pop-up is submitted.

read-tv exports 5 functions and 3 data sets. The 5 functions are:   

* ```launchReadtv``` 
    + launch the application  
* ```tvOpts``` 
    + tells the plot to load with the specified axes, colors, etc.  
    + used with ```launchReadtv```'s ```plotOpts``` argument
* ```preprocessForCpa```  
    + regularly spaces and smooths time series data
    + used in the ```CPA``` tabs
    + how to use visible from ```Source Code``` sub-tab.
* ```slidingWindow```  
    + same sub-points as ```preprocessForCpa```.  
* ```generatePlotDefaults``` 
    + user can run ```generatePlotDefaults()``` to view defaults for ```tvOpts```

Each of these functions has associated help documentation. The 3 data sets are:  
* [Global COVID data, from Our World in  Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)  
* [US state-based COVID data, from NY Times](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv)  
* [USGS seismic records from Japan on March 11, 2011](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map).


### CPA tab

The CPA tab has features to regularly space the data (preprocess), and then execute methods from the changepoints package. It spaces the data with the ```preprocessForCpa``` function and ```slidingWindow``` function.

To avoid the column mapping pop up, we can use dplyr to specify the columns and mock values (Case) before it is passed into ```launchReadtv```.

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(magrittr)
library(readtv)

app = readtv::japan_eq_3_11 %>% 
  mutate(Time = time, Event.Type = place, Case = 1) %>% 
  launchReadtv(plotOpts = tvOpts(y = mag, x = Time, color = place))

#shiny::runApp(app) # and move to CPA tab after viewing in Basic display tab
```

Below is a screen shot from read-tv. Note that the time points are regularized with values interpolated through a sliding window. The timing intervals were not originally evenly spaced (irregular) since it is earthquake event data. The CPA tab has functionality to create regular spacing.

### Faceting

Sometimes it helps to facet and paginate the data.
```{r}
app = readtv::covid_usa %>% 
  mutate(Time = date, Case = state, Event.Type = state) %>% 
  launchReadtv(plotOpts = 
                 tvOpts(y = cases, facetOn = state, isFacetPaginated = TRUE,
                        facetRowsPerPage = 3))

#shiny::runApp(app)
```

And the source code can also be viewed from the app. _Please note that it assumes ```tidyverse```, ```changepoint```, ```ggforce```, and ```readtv``` packages are attached_.
